When adding data, place your xml files in a directory:

Core -> High quality real data that can be used as a starting point for a new Hedgehog install.
Demo -> Fictious Facilities, Inspections, Risk Assessments, Nexus Issues used to give realistic demos.
Developer -> Data added by developers to test new functionality that the BAs will later replace with quality data.
